Instructions? Yeah I got them. Calm

Works ONLY for the University of Michigan 
lecture hosting program. Couldn't find what it was called. 

STEPS:
- Hit the transcript button
- Inspect element on any line of the transcript
- Find <div role="list" class="transcript-scroller">
- Right click on that line, find 'copy', click 'copy element'
- Paste that into the transcript.html
- Run 'python3 transcript.py transcript.html [output_file_name].txt
- Done! Now have a .txt file of the transcript

Put into chat to get a little summary if you desire!
